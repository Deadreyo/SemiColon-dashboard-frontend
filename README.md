## Design Choices

### UI Components
We chose some basic UI components to use throughout the design of other componenst, such as a basic Card component that can have some design defaults such as a ```max-width: 80%``` or a basic background color, a 
Button component, a DropDown menu component, an InputBar component, a StackedBtn component for the mobile navbar, and a Header component that renders different headers depending on what is the role of the signed in member.

### Data Handling
We are using React-Context and axios to handle fetching data from the backend on the ```/getAll``` API to fetch all participants data and handle them only once in the frontend to prevent backend abuse. We are also authenticating user before sending a fetch request to the backend to prevent trying to fetch without having the required token.

The context provides the following type
```ts
interface DataCtxTypes {
  data: Participant[]
  fetchData: () => Promise<void>
}
```
